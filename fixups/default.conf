#   | frame_skip       | positive integer |

#   | random_frame     | boolean          |

# vcom: mandatory option, floating point number
#
#   This is the voltage for the connected e-paper device.
#
#   IMPORTANT: Read and use the exact voltage from the flexible,
#              printed circuit cable of the connected device.
vcom = -1.48

# display_resolution: mandatory option, string
#
#   This is the resolution of the connected e-paper device.
#
#   Specify the string value in one of the following formats:
#     - 1872 1404
#     - 1872x1404
#     - 1872 x 1404
#     - 1872X1404
#     - 1872 X 1404
#     - 1872, 1404
#     - 1872; 1404
#
#   You may enclose the value between single or double quotes
#   (e.g. '1872 x 1404') but it is not necessary.
display_resolution = 1872x1404

# refresh_timeout: mandatory option, non-negative floating point number
#
#   This is the amount of time measured in seconds while a single
#   frame will be on the screen before advancing to the next one.
#   (Measured in seconds.)
refresh_timeout = 180.0

# video_directory: mandatory option, string
#
#   This is the absolute path to the directory which contain the videos
#   you want to play with the Slow Movie Player Service.
#
#   You may enclose the value between single or double quotes
#   (e.g. "/path/to/video/directory") but it is not necessary.
video_directory = /videos

# frame_skip: optional, positive integer
# time_skip: optional, positive floating point number
#
#   frame_skip is the amount of frames to advance in the video when
#   advancing to the next frame to display.
#   (Measured in number of frames.)
#
#   time_skip is the amount of time, measured in milliseconds, to advance
#   in the video when advancing to the next frame to display.
#   (Measured in milliseconds.)
#
#   By adjusting these settings you may control how long the playback of
#   videos will take with the Slow Movie Player Service.
#
#   Let's see a couple of examples for playback durations with different
#   frame_skip and time_skip settings.
#
#   Example #1: Take a video with a 24 frames per second frame rate and
#               with a 90 minute duration, frame_skip set to 1 with
#               refresh_timeout set to 180.0 seconds (3 minutes).
#
#               In this case, the playback would roughly take up
#               90 × 60 × 24 × 180.0 seconds, or 270 days,
#               or 38 weeks and 4 days.
#
#   Example #2: Take the same video and refresh_timeout setting as in
#               Example #1, but set frame_skip to 3.
#
#               In this case the playback would take up
#               (90 × 60 × 24) / 3 × 180.0 seconds which is only 90 days,
#               or 12 weeks and 6 days.
#
#   Example #3: Take a 45 minute video with a 48 frames per second frame
#               rate and another 45 minute long video with a 29.97 frames
#               per second frame rate, refresh_timeout set to 180.0 seconds
#               (3 minutes) and time_skip set to 100.0 milliseconds.
#
#               In this case the total playback time of the two videos
#               would take (45 + 45) × 60 × (1000 / 100.0) × 180.0 seconds,
#               which is 112 days and 12 hours, or 16 weeks and 12 hours.
#               (Also note that the frame rate of the videos did not affect
#               the total playback time in this case.)
#
#   frame_skip and time_skip are optional settings, so you may comment
#   them out, in that case the Slow Movie Player Service will display
#   all frames in videos. (Equivalent with specifying 'frame_skip = 1'.)
#
#   If both frame_skip and time_skip options are set, then the time_skip
#   option will take effect.
#
#   Examples:
#     - frame_skip = 1     Every frame will be displayed.
#     - frame_skip = 2     Only every other frame will be displayed.
#     - frame_skip = 10    Only every tenth frame will be displayed.
#     - time_skip = 100.0  A frame of every tenth of a second of the video
#                          will be displayed.
frame_skip = 3
time_skip = 100.0

# grayscale_method: optional, string
#
#   This is the grayscale method which is applied to a video frame when
#   applying Floyd-Steinberg dithering (along with a 4 bits per pixel
#   color map).
#
#   Valid options are the following: Rec601Luma, Rec601Luminance,
#                                    Rec709Luma, Rec709Luminance,
#                                    Brightness, Lightness, Average,
#                                    MS, RMS.
#
#   For further details about the grayscale methods, please see:
#     - https://imagemagick.org/Usage/color_mods/#grayscale
#     - https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php?#grayscale
#     - https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php?#intensity
#
#   grayscale_method is optional, so you may comment out this setting.
#   In this case the default 'Rec709Luma' grayscale method will be used.
#
#   You may enclose the value between single or double quotes
#   (e.g. 'Rec601Luminance') but it is not necessary.
grayscale_method = Rec709Luma

# random_frame: optional, boolean
#
#   By turning on this option, the Slow Movie Player Service will randomly
#   display a frame from a random video in the video_directory directory
#   every refresh_timeout seconds.
#
#   If this option is turned on, then then specified frame_skip and
#   time_skip settings are not taken into account.
#
#   Valid options are the following: 1, yes, true, on, 0, no, false, off.
#
#   random_frame is optional, so you may comment out this setting.
#   In this case the random_frame option is turned off.
random_frame = false
